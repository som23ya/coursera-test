            This Greg Daniels series on Amazon Prime Video is certainly the best thing that we have seen this year. In the science-fiction comedy-drama, we are introduced to a dystopian concept where humans can ‘upload’ themselves in a virtual afterlife. We follow Nathan, who is still living as per his living girlfriend’s rules even though he is dead.
